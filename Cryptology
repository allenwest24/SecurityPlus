Obfiscation - messing up data
 
Session key - key being used to communicate
 
 DES - block encryption 
 
 RC4 - streaming cipher
 
 Nobody uses ECB anymore.
 
 AES - symmetrical
 
Assymetric Encryption - two keys used
    - Public key is sent out to everyone so they can send it to me.
    - The private thing is the only thing that can decrypt what the public key sent
    - Prime * Prime == SemiPrime

Diffie-Hellman
    - Bob and Alice need the same key without mallory getting it.
    - Bob and alice create random value
    - Eve can see this value
    - They exchange the values, and mix theirs, creating a unique value to them.

PGP Encryption
    - Generate random key, then encrypt it to send an encrypted message.
    - Sometimes we use assymetric keys for the session ID but for the rest of the 
      communnication we just use symmetiric

Hash
    - Creates integrity
    - Takes large data and puts it into a fix size data
    - hashes are one way
    - collisions: creating some same value for two different data
    - Types of hashes
        - Message Digest 5 (MD5): Uses 128 bit hash
        - SHA: 160 bit hash
        - RIPEMD: 128, 160, ...
    - Password storage
    - HMAC generates hash with the key

Steganography
    - Taking data and hiding it in other data
    - Don't even know that the data is there
    - Sometimes this is used in pictures
 
PKI: Public Key Infastructure
    - A lot of things use certificates.
    - Certificate Authority have root certificate that can sign and distribute other certificates.
    - All the intermediate authorities they sign, like evrasign can do the same because they are 
      trusted by the root keys.
    - No standard except PKCS
  
Cryptographic attacks
    - Store your passwords in hashes not clear text
 
 Missede Questions on End Quiz
  - Which symmetric block encryption has a variable key size between 32-448 bits?
      - Blowfish is correct. DES has 56-bit keys, Triple DES has 168-bit keys, and AES has key sizes of 128, 192, or 256-bits.
