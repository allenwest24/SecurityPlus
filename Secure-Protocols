Secure Applications and Protocols
    - TCP/IP and the internet
        - predate encryption
        - no encrytion
    - SSH protocol
        - Putty
        - initial key exchange
        - symetric key to exchange data
    - HTTP
        - TLS - intermediary to do the encryption between website and you
        
Network Models (TBD)
    - OSI seven layer model
        - Physical layer
        - data link layer - mac address, siwtch network card
        - Network layer - IP addresses
        - transport - dissassembles and pushes packets
        - session - good connections
        - presentation - old and weird
        - Application
    - TCP/IP
        - Network interface 
        - internet
        - transport
        - application
        
Know your protocols
    - IP addressing
    - private ip address
        - start with 10
        - 192.168
    - NAT
    - IPV6 is newer and super long
    - 128 bits
    - TCP - connection oriented protocol
    - Three-way handshake
    - UDP
        - connectionless
        - lots of packets
    - ICMP
        - maitnenance of networks
        - ARP and ping
    
Ports
    - 80 http
    - 443 https
    - 23 telnet
    - 22 ssh
    - 20/21 FTPs
    - 22 SCP
    - 69 tftp
    - 445 SMB
    - 25 smtb
    - 143 IMAP
    - 53 DNS
    - Theres a lot more, just look it up if you need it essentially
    
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - Website need security
    - SSL is super old
    - orginally ffor https
    - want to make a secure connection between some server and some client
    - Secure connection
        - Encryption
        - Symmetric is faster
        - Key exchange
        - Authentication
        - HMAC
    - SSL is now used all over the internet
    
Internet Service Hardening
    - Use secure protocols
    - DNS
        - Been around since the beginning of the itnernet
        - port 53
        - Nonsecure protocol
        - Way it works
            - My computer needs an ip add
            - goes to its DNS server
            - marches through dns hierarhcy
            - tries to resolve with ip info pass down to client
            - Other computer might act as a spoofer
        - DNSSEC
            - forces authentication
            - uses pair of keys
            - public signing key
            - gets rid of MITM
            - not encryption, just authentication
            - popular for public dns servers
    - Email
        - smtp server
        - data shoud be sent with encryption and auth
    - USE SUPPORT PROTOCOLS
    
Protecting ypur servers
    - DMZ between Server router and internet
    - firewall
    - SSL accelerated
    
Secure code development
    - Waterfall is old school
    - Agile
    - Devops
    - Secure DevOps
        - Security automation tools
        - always looking for vulnerabilities
        - change management/version control
        - baselining security objectives
        - Consider immutable systems
        
Secure Deployment Concepts
    - Compiled vs runtime code
    - proper error handeling
    - Validating input
    - normalization
        - indexing to create efficient data bases
    - storage
    - encryption
    - obfuscation
    - dead code/ reused code
    - memory management
    - third party libraries
    - data exposure
    
Code Quality and testing
    - two types of tests
        - static code analyzing
        - dynamic analysis
    - staging
    - stress test
    - sandbox
    - deployment or dporuductiona after model verification
