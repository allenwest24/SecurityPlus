Secure Applications and Protocols
    - TCP/IP and the internet
        - predate encryption
        - no encrytion
    - SSH protocol
        - Putty
        - initial key exchange
        - symetric key to exchange data
    - HTTP
        - TLS - intermediary to do the encryption between website and you
        
Network Models (TBD)
    - OSI seven layer model
        - Physical layer
        - data link layer - mac address, siwtch network card
        - Network layer - IP addresses
        - transport - dissassembles and pushes packets
        - session - good connections
        - presentation - old and weird
        - Application
    - TCP/IP
        - Network interface 
        - internet
        - transport
        - application
        
Know your protocols
    - IP addressing
    - private ip address
        - start with 10
        - 192.168
    - NAT
    - IPV6 is newer and super long
    - 128 bits
    - TCP - connection oriented protocol
    - Three-way handshake
    - UDP
        - connectionless
        - lots of packets
    - ICMP
        - maitnenance of networks
        - ARP and ping
