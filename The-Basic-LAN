LAN-Review
    - Switches
        - filter and forward data based on MAC addresses
        - VLAN
        - assign ports to create multiple switches with vlan
        - Layer 2 separation
        - flood protection with stp
    - Routers 
        - filter and forward based on IP adresses 
        - layer 3 switch
        - doorway between different network ids
        - local area network/ gateway router
        - firewall is run on gateway router to filter based on urls or ip addresses
        
Network Topologies Review
    - actual organization of the network / how data move arounds
    - broadcast domain is all computer that hear the brodcast being sent out by a machine (LAN)
    - if we extend and break it up into multiple LAN in a WAN 
    - TCP/IP 
    - intranet is a private network that runs on ^
    
Network Zone Review
    - computers connecting to switches (LAN)
    - zone ^
    - VLAN - one or more physical switches and chop up into multiple broadcast domains
    - DMZ - two routers with firewalls and  servers in between
    - wireless network
    - guest network 
    - virtualization zone - vms running in the computer
    - airgap - networks are isolated from each other
    
Network Access Controls
    - wireless network
    - remote access
    - VPN
    - point to point protocol
        - PPP
        - transport layer protocol
        - get address information
        - rudementary security protocols
    - EAP - framwork that handles authentication
        - EAP-MD5 - hash with MD5
        - PSK - predetermined symmetric keys
        - TLS certificates
        - TTLS only the server has the certificate
        
The Network Firewall
    - to configure open the internet with that IP address
    - stateless firewall is where they blokc by certain characteristics
    - statefull looks at what is going on and decides what to do
        - too many pings, block the pings
    - implicit deny (deny unless manually authorized)
    - block webistes
    - application firewall is different
    
Proxy Servers
    - Proxy is a box/ piece of software running on a computer that acts as an intermediary between two 
      different devices having a session
    - application specific
    - forward and reverse
        - forward proxy
            - provides hashing ans content monitoring
            - blokcs certain kinds of stuff
            - encrypted tunnel with a vpn
            - with TOR if picks a random node to change where you are coming from
        - reverse proxy
            - protect server from evil people
            - load balancing
            - encryption acceleration
    - forward hides client, reverse hides the servers
    
Honeypots
    - emulate a post or network to let someone in and track them
    - emulates a server
    - logs what is typed
    - honeybot
    - puts them in the DMZ
    - honeynet
    
Virtual Private Networks
    - want to connect to a LAN somewhere else
    - end points
        - vpn tunnel between two endpoints
        - remote access vpn
    - site to site vpn changes entire router to provide specific IP addresses
    - split versus full tunneling
    
IPSec
    - protocols that allow for any host to connect securely
    - HMAC
    - capsulating into a IPSec packet
    - transport mode 
    - tunnel mode

NIDS and NIPS
    - detection != prevention
    
SIEM
    - agreggation - grabbing data
        - sensory devices
        - logs
        - WORM - write once read many
    - correlation - context
