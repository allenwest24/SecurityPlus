System Resiliency
    - scalability
    - elasticity
        - back and forth between large and small depending on needs
    - redundancy
        - backups
    -  non-persistance
        - snapshot - binary snapshots
    - known state
        - if something went wrong go back to when it was known to be working.
    - Rollback
        - drivers for windows
        
RAID
    - Random Array Of Independent Devices
    - RAID 0 
        - increase speed of getting data
        - many drives to access faster
        - no data integrity
    - RAID 1 
        - even number of drives
        - copies
        - integrity without speed
    - parody
        - combining parts of data so that we know what is missing, should it be lost
    - RAID 2 
        - minimum of 3 harddrives
        - dedicated parody drive with two distributed hardrives
    - RAID 5 
        - distribute data and parody to at least three drives
    - RAID 6
        - minimum of 4 drives
        - two parodies distributed so that we can lose at least two drives
    - RAID 01
        - mirrorede data of striped
    - RAID 10
        - smae ish but revers
    - integrity/speed
    
NAS and SAN
    - Network attached storage
        - RAIDed drives
        - linx
        - box
        - runs over a standard network
        - shows up as a share of the network
    - Storage area network
        - new hard drives
        - boot functionality
        - storage
    
Physical Hardening
    - removable media controls
        - no CDRoms or insertable stuff
        - configure your OS
        - not able to read removable media
    - Data execution Protocol (DEP)
        - advanced system setting -> performance
        - not really important
    - disabling ports
        - USB mass sotrage driver support to stop USB access
        
RFI, EMI, and ESD
    - Radio frequency interference (RFI)
        - EMI if its radio
    - Electromagnetic interference (EMI)
        - protecting wires
        - individual electric charges
    - electrostatic discharge (ESD)
        - everything has some electric charge
        - keep everything at the same potential
        
Host Hardening
    - disabling unnecessary services
        - go to properties and disable
    - use netstat to see
    - not using default passwords
    - disabling unnecessary user accounts
    - least privlege
    - patch management
        - monitor/be aware of new patches
        - test the patch
        - evaluate
        - deploy patch/ scheduling issues

Data and System Security
    - permissions based issues
    - data integrity
    - speed/quick access
    - high availability
    - RAID 
        - good for drives or storage of a system
    - cluster
        - instead of one computer, have mulitple systems that can do a specific thing.
        - update each other the same. 
    - load balancing
    - virtualizing the server with a snapshot
