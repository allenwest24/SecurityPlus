Wireless Review
    - 802.11 WAP to ethernet
    - all devices have MAC address
        - configure the WAP with a SSID
        - broadcasted to network
        - associate the MAC address with the SSID = BSSID
        - client requests to connect and can be authenticcated by the clients mac address
    - Common Ethernet Boradcast Domain is multiple WAPs connected by a ESSID to identify them
    - above has no auth or integrity
    - fix is WEP
        - share key
        - easily hacked mathmaticaly
    - 802.11i new authentication
    - AES encryption
    - WPA
    - WPA2
    
Living in Open Networks
    - networks are absolutely open
    - cookie cadger
        - replay attack
        - SSL stripping
    - https everywhere
        - extension
        - block all insecure requests
        - HSTS
    - VPN
        - enforce security 
    
Vulnetabilities with Wireless Access Point
    - Rogue ap - roague access point like extra router
    - evil twin if private
    - 802.11 jammer
        - denies ranges of channels
        - jam a chennel and evil twin to replace the current with another and people will try to enter 
          the password for the normal one
        - can use deauth instead kinda
        
Cracking 802.11 - WEP
    - Cracking WEP
        - old school
        - 50% still running this
        - easily cracked
        - IV attacks
        - Aircrack-ng
            - what network cards we have - $airmon-ng
            - monitor on that device - $airmon-ng start wlan0
            - go look and tell me what you see (wireless networks) - $airodump-ng wlan0mon
            - ^ found mac address
            - write the data it grabs - $airodump-ng -w dumpfile -c 6 --bssid ma:ca:dd:re:ss wlan0mon
            - actually run the aircrack - $aircrack-ng dumpfile-01.cap
            
Cracking 802.11 - WPA
    - WPA is a good encryption
    - 4 way handshake
    - disctionary attacks
    - use airodump to find ahndshakes
    
Cracking 802.11 - WPS
    - wfif proteccted setup
    - button start
    - hardware key to configure itself
    - 8 digit key for use in initial key

Virtualization Basics
    - virtualize computer into itself maybe as a different version
    - system recovery

Virtual Security
    - Example in VirtualBox
    - VM manager
    - VMWare client
    - Cloud-Based Virutalization
    - Type 1 and 2 Hpervisor
    - Virtualization itself is a security feature
    - SandBoxing

        - Separate from main network by creating switch
    - Snapshots and backups
    - Virtual threats
        - anything that happens to normal machine can happen
        - cloud based has a lot of recomendations for you.
        - Security as a service
        - VM Sprawl is when everyone sets up vms differently
    - Hardening virutalization
        - remove remnant data
        - make good policies
        - define user privleges
        - patch everything
        - cloud access security brokers
            - intermediary between device and cloud 
            - monitor everything
    
Containers
    - software edevelopment world

    - hypervisro virtualizes the software on it
    - container is a vm for an application...kinda
    - applications isolated from everything
    - Docker
    - affords one os with everything above the kernel
    - security of isolation and only allow a specific fucntion
    
Infastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - someone setsup infastructures as a service
    - amazon web services
    - IP, firewall, etc
    
platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Deals with the garbage associated with programming
