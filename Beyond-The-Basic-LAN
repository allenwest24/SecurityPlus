Wireless Review
    - 802.11 WAP to ethernet
    - all devices have MAC address
        - configure the WAP with a SSID
        - broadcasted to network
        - associate the MAC address with the SSID = BSSID
        - client requests to connect and can be authenticcated by the clients mac address
    - Common Ethernet Boradcast Domain is multiple WAPs connected by a ESSID to identify them
    - above has no auth or integrity
    - fix is WEP
        - share key
        - easily hacked mathmaticaly
    - 802.11i new authentication
    - AES encryption
    - WPA
    - WPA2
    
Living in Open Networks
    - networks are absolutely open
    - cookie cadger
        - replay attack
        - SSL stripping
    - https everywhere
        - extension
        - block all insecure requests
        - HSTS
    - VPN
        - enforce security 
    
Vulnetabilities with Wireless Access Point
    - Rogue ap - roague access point like extra router
    - evil twin if private
    - 802.11 jammer
        - denies ranges of channels
        - jam a chennel and evil twin to replace the current with another and people will try to enter 
          the password for the normal one
        - can use deauth instead kinda
        
Cracking 802.11 - WEP
    - Cracking WEP
        - old school
        - 50% still running this
        - easily cracked
        - IV attacks
        - Aircrack-ng
            - what network cards we have - $airmon-ng
            - monitor on that device - $airmon-ng start wlan0
            - go look and tell me what you see (wireless networks) - $airodump-ng wlan0mon
            - ^ found mac address
            - write the data it grabs - $airodump-ng -w dumpfile -c 6 --bssid ma:ca:dd:re:ss wlan0mon
            - actually run the aircrack - $aircrack-ng dumpfile-01.cap
            
Cracking 802.11 - WPA
    - WPA is a good encryption
    - 4 way handshake
    - disctionary attacks
    - use airodump to find ahndshakes
    
Cracking 802.11 - WPS
    - wfif proteccted setup
    - button start
    - hardware key to configure itself
    - 8 digit key for use in initial key
    
Wireless Hardening
    - Survey installation issues
        - survey tools
        - find ssids
        - find mac addresses
        - bands channels, etc
        - heatmap
    - maintaining existing wireless networks
        - good documentation
        - SSID turning off doesnt really matter
        - mac filtering
        - AP Isolation
            - cant see each other when connected to the access point
        - scanning
    - monitor wireless networks
        - Wireless intrusion protection system
        - watches working protocols
        - sensors around WAPs to check if anything weird is happening
        - logs sent to WIDS
    - define how to defend wireless clients
        
Wireless Access Points
    - Think enterprise
    - thick/thin - web configure/software sets up everything
    - Atenna types
        - omni directional : basketball
        - dipole : for a single floor
        - directional
    - placement is important
    - Band selection
    
Virtualization Basics
    - virtualize computer into itself maybe as a different version
    - system recovery
    - hypervisor runs on top of OS
    
Virtual Security
    - Example in VirtualBox
    - VM manager
    - VMWare client
    - Cloud-Based Virutalization
    - Type 1 and 2 Hpervisor
    - Virtualization itself is a security feature
    - SandBoxing
    - Network separation
        - Separate from main network by creating switch
    - Snapshots and backups
    - Virtual threats
        - anything that happens to normal machine can happen
        - cloud based has a lot of recomendations for you.
        - Security as a service
        - VM Sprawl is when everyone sets up vms differently
    - Hardening virutalization
        - remove remnant data
        - make good policies
        - define user privleges
        - patch everything
        - cloud access security brokers
            - intermediary between device and cloud 
            - monitor everything
    
Containers
    - software edevelopment world
    - libraries and binaries
    - hypervisro virtualizes the software on it
    - container is a vm for an application...kinda
    - applications isolated from everything
    - Docker
    - affords one os with everything above the kernel
    - security of isolation and only allow a specific fucntion
    
Infastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - someone setsup infastructures as a service
    - amazon web services
    - IP, firewall, etc
    
platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Deals with the garbage associated with programming
    - Heroku
    - upload, give url, deploy
    - web application
    - can use from a command line
    - Dynos
    
Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Buy a subscription
    - gets rid of optical medium
    - Microsoft Office 365
    - Not necessarily downloading onto your machine
    
Deployment Methods
    - Old days you have to buy a server to install a bunch of stuff
    - Hosted application
        - your computer in their facility
        - our computer you put your application on it
    - Eventually turned into the cloud
    - Clouds
        - private cloud
        - public cloud
        - hybrid cloud - half half
        - Community cloud
    - virtualizing our desktops
        - VDE
        - VDI
    
Static Hosts
    - Internet of things
    - device designed to do a specific thing
    - network aware
    - Industrial control systems (ICS)
        - HVAC
    - Long range falls into Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
        - Cellular LAN to provide autonomy
    - How to secure
        - User accounts and passwords
        - turn off default services
        - think about it like a normal host
        - monitor
        - Firmware updates manually usually
    - Defense in depth
        - Network segmentation
        - Separate by VLANs
        - With scada, we can use VPNs
